      <h3>Overview of Project</h3> 
      Project is to create an interactive
      visualization that will enable users to play with the data and find
      different types of information about the comic book characters. 

      <h3>Features Completed</h3> 
      Preprocessing of Data 
      
      <h3>Upcoming Milestones</h3> 
      The next milestone in the project would be to use D3 to make all these visualizations in a
      static way first before adding any visualizations. 
      
      <h3>Roadblocks</h3> 
      While creating the graphs for the Alpha Release, I had difficulty creating the
      node-link diagram. Does data for a network graph need to be stored in some
      special way ?
